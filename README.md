# discord-ai-chatbots
A repository for my various experiments with Discord chatbots. Based on [llmcord](https://github.com/jakobdylanc/llmcord).

With inspiration from [this](https://github.com/vndee/local-talking-llm) and [this](https://github.com/fordinator/talking-LLM-chatbot).

Mostly here to protect me as the Original Creator.

And all the AI models I've known over the years...
